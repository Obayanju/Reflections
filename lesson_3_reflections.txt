When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    This would be useful if one wants to share code with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Sometimes, we don't want every change made on a GitHub repo to be visible on our local repo,
    so we pull the ones we are interested in manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks -  when you want a version of someone else's repo so you can clone it and do wateva
    clones - this a a copy of my own repo
    branches - they are used for making feautures

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
    If you want to go offline, you can update your local repo even if you aren't ready to merge
    the changes into your own branch.
